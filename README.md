## App Name: Simulated DriVR
<b>Simulated DriVR</b> is a virtual reality driving simulator that will help learners transition from theory-based learning to practical in a low risk, low anxiety environment

### For Individual Learner Drivers
After having used the app, learners will have acquired some knowledge and confidence in themselves. This will improve their starting proficiency and reduce the number  of lessons they have to take (saving them money).

### For Driving Schools
It will help driving schools become more resource-efficient: it will reduce the amount of time each instructor spends per learner and enable them to accept a bigger cohort of learners. It will reduce unit-costs in fuel spent, vehicle wear-and-tear as well as accident & hijack risk

### The App
will be delivered through an immersive virtual reality experience that will replace reality as much as possible
It will use custom designed & 3D printed peripheral input devices (A table-top steering wheel, gear stick and pedals)
